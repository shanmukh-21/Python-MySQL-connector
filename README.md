# Python-MySQL-connector
A project where i have tried to run the sql commands through the Jupyter Notebook by using libraries such as mysql-connector-python, pandas. Implemented the way to create a database, create a table, inserting the values into the table and querying the data.
Here I have created a company database having different tables. Firstly i have imported the library called mysql-connector-python by using the following command : 
import mysql.connector
To install the library please use the below command to install:
!pip install mysql-connector-python
Now I will summarize the steps which I have executed in this project:
1. Imported Libraries.
2. Creating a connection with a server    : This for connecting to the MySQL Workbench and provide the username as well as password.
3. Creating a Database                    : Here we will use the cursor() method to connect to the object.
4. Connecting to a Database               : Making a connection to the database.
5. Creating the tables.
6. Inserting the values into the tables.
7. Inserting the values in the form of lists.
8. Querying the data i.e., reading the data from the created tables.
